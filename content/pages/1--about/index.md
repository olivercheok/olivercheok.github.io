I am a business consultant in a banking software company, with experience in database management. My background in electrical engineering provided me with problem solving skills which eventually led to software. Nowadays, I get to interact with different clients and expose myself to different cultures which I use as an opportunity to share our newest technologies. I like to challenge myself to share technical information to business users as it allows me to improve on my professional development.

I had purchased a online course on High Immersion Virtual Reality and an Oculus Rift which led to $2000 leaving my wallet. Thankfully, I managed to come up with a VR game that I am proud of. Being able to interact with virtual objects that I had personally created provides me a fulfiling experience. I believe **grit** played an important role to what I was able to accomplish. To be able to keep on working on what you love is the best contributor to success.

Right now, I am working on my 3D modelling skills to use my passion for VR and build personalised experiences for people. I look forward to a job in the VR industry where my content creation can contribute value to the lives of everyday people.
