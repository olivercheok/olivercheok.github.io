**Oliver Cheok** I'm a business consultant turned software engineer who loves Virtual Reality (VR). My latest project is a high immersion game that lets Users build their own contraptions to get a ball from one point to another without it touching the floor. Right now, I am working on improving my 3D Modelling skills to use my passion for VR to build personalised experiences for people.
